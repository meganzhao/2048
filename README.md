# 2048 
The project is a Java desktop application that implements the sliding block puzzle game by Gabriele Cirulli with some variations. There are three levels in this game. The first level is the original version of the game. The second level adds the gravity feature: when the users reach a certain score, the board will turn and the tiles will drop down as if they are pulled by gravity. In the third level, the tiles with the same value substract from each other when the board turns. We are still working on this level.

## How To Run
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/meganzhao/2048.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd 2048

# Go into the source folder
$ cd src

# Run the app
$ java MainPage
```
## How To Play
Use arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with the value of the two numbers added up.
