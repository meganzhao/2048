* The Gamepage.java is the game GUI of our game. When the user chooses a level in the welcomeHelp page, it directs to the gamepage.

* There are three levels in this game. The first level is the same as the original game. We added additional features in the second and third level (see descriptions). In the second level, when the users reach a certain score, the board will turn, and the tiles will drop down as if they are pulled by gravity.

In the third level, to not only plan to turn the board, but also make the tiles with the same value substract from each other. We are still working on this level. 

More detailed descriptions of the game can be found in 'help' in the game.
